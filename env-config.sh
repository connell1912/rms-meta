# This script configures the system environment for a user
# who has just downloaded RMS. It works for Linux, OSX,
# Git Bash (MGW64) and several other systems.

# What this script does:
# 1. Checks its runtime environment.
# 2. Copies pre-commit to .git/hooks directory.
# 3. Adds alias for google-java-format-X.X-all-deps.jar to
#    ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile ~/tcshrc depending on environment.

# Use uname (Unix name) -s (system) to retrieve information about the current system (typically the OS or kernel)
# uname is part of the POSIX standard, meaning that there is a high degree of certainty that it is implemented and
# consistently so on *nix systems.
